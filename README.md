Hey guys!

For anyone new to the github repository system I reccomend you look up a tutorial to get yourself acquainted

Other than that there are a few things you should know:
You can update documents either directly in github or by importing the repository to github. Be careful to only update documents you know to be the only one working on currently or else you may overwrite someone else's work.

If you decide to import the repository do know that you will have to perioidically refresh with the upstream to ensure your code is up to date

I will add more as I become more familiar with github
